To delve deeper into constructing the generator matrix $G$ for a linear systematic code with parameters $(n, k)$, let's examine the matrix algebra and the configuration of the component matrices in detail.

### Definitions
- **$n$**: Total number of bits in each codeword.
- **$k$**: Number of information (message) bits.
- **$G$**: Generator matrix used to encode messages into codewords, of dimension $k \times n$.
- **$I_k$**: Identity matrix of size $k \times k$, represents the systematic part of the codeword.
- **$P$**: Parity matrix of size $k \times (n-k)$, used to calculate parity bits based on the message bits.

### Mathematical Configuration of $G$
The generator matrix $G$ in a systematic form is constructed as:
$ G = [I_k \mid P] $
Where:
- **$I_k$** is the identity matrix, ensuring that each row of $G$ operates to copy an individual message bit directly into the codeword.
- **$P$** is designed to generate the necessary parity bits that provide the desired error detection and correction capabilities.

### Constructing $I_k$
The identity matrix $I_k$ is straightforward:
$$I_k = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
\end{bmatrix}_{k \times k} $$
Each row in $I_k$ represents a basis vector in the $k$-dimensional vector space over the field (usually binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$).

### Designing $P$
The parity matrix $P$, which is of size $k \times (n-k)$, is more complex and depends on the specific error control requirements of the code. Each column of $P$ should be carefully chosen to ensure the entire matrix $G$ provides the necessary minimum Hamming distance, which directly correlates with error detection and correction capabilities.

### Example Formulation of $P$
If we are designing a simple parity-check code, each column of $P$ could be designed to cover different combinations of message bits to ensure that any single error can be detected or corrected. For example, in a simple code, you might design $P$ to ensure that each parity bit is the sum (modulo 2) of a unique subset of the message bits.

### Encoding Message
The encoding process of a message vector $\mathbf{m}$ (of length $k$) into a codeword $\mathbf{c}$ (of length $n$) using the generator matrix $G$ is given by:
$ \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{m}G $
This operation involves matrix multiplication over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$ (or the relevant field for the code), where addition and multiplication are typically modulo 2 for binary codes.

### Example with Mathematical Expressions
Consider a (7,4) code with $G$ as proposed:
$$ G = [I_4 \mid P] $$
Suppose we select $P$ as:
$$ P = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix} $$

This selection of $P$ implies certain relationships among the message bits for generating each parity bit. The message $\mathbf{m} = [m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4]$ would be encoded as:
$ \mathbf{c} = [m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_1 \oplus m_2, m_2 \oplus m_3, m_3 \oplus m_4, m_1 \oplus m_2 \oplus m_3 \oplus m_4] $

### Validation
To ensure $G$ is correctly designed, one must verify:
- The rank of $G$ is $k$.
- The minimum distance (or weight) of the code generated by $G$ meets the design criteria for error detection or correction.

This detailed explanation covers the mathematical construction and considerations in designing the generator matrix $G$ for systematic linear codes.
